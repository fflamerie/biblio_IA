	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of two exotic tree species (pine and eucalypts) on the early growth of Uapaca bojeri (an endemic tree species from Madagascar) via their influence on soil chemical, microbial characteristics, on ectomycorrhizal fungal community structures in a Madagascarian highland forest and to test the ability of an early-successional ectomycorrhizal shrub, Leptolena bojeriana, to mitigate the impacts of these exotic species. Finally, we hypothesized that L. bojeriana could act as a natural provider for ectomycorrhizal propagules. Soil bioassays were conducted with U. bojeri seedlings grown in soils collected under the native tree species (U. bojeri and L. bojeriana) and two exotic tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Pinus patula) and in the same soils but previously cultured by L. bojeriana seedlings. This study clearly shows that (1) the introduction of exotic tree species induces significant changes in soil biotic and abiotic characteristics, (2) exotic-invaded soil significantly reduces the early growth and ectomycorrhization of U. bojeri seedlings and (3) L. bojeriana decreased these negative effects of the exotic tree species by facilitating ectomycorrhizal establishment and consequently improved the U. bojeri early growth. This study provides evidence that L. bojeriana can facilitate the ectomycorrhizal infection of U. bojeri and mitigates the negative effects of the introduction of exotic tree species on the early growth of the native tree species. From a practical point of view, the use of ectotrophic early-successional shrub species should be considered to improve forest resaturation after exotic invasion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Untangling the relative influences of environmental filtering and biotic interactions on species coexistence at various spatial scales is a long-held issue in community ecology. Separating these processes is especially important to understand the influences of introduced exotic species on the composition of native communities. For this aim, we investigated coexistence patterns in New Zealand exotic and native birds along multiple-scale habitat gradients. We built a Bayesian hierarchical model, contrasting the abundance variations of 10 native and 11 exotic species in 501 point counts spread along landscape and local-scale gradients of forest structure and composition. Although native and exotic species both occurred in a wide range of habitats, they were separated by landscape-level variables. Exotic species were most abundant in exotic conifer plantations embedded in farmland matrices, while native birds predominated in areas dominated by continuous native forest. In exotic plantation forests, and to a lesser extent in native forests, locally co-occurring exotic and native species were segregated along a gradient of vegetation height. These results support the prediction that exotic and native bird species are segregated along gradients related to anthropogenic disturbance and habitat availability. In addition, native and exotic species overlapped little in a multivariate functional space based on 10 life history traits associated with habitat selection. Hence, habitat segregation patterns were probably mediated more by environmental filtering processes than by competition at landscape and local scales. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Oak biotopes usually present higher values of diversity and species richness, with a greater total number of species and also more exclusive and/or preferential species than eucalyptus biotopes. No significant differences were detected among the different biotopes in terms of mean number of individuals. However, the abundance of individuals in eucalyptus biotopes results mainly from the presence of a few species which are represented by a great number of specimens, making up more than 85\% of the individuals on eucalyptus sites.},

The evaluation of these crops as to the environmental impact on attributes that can guarantee their productivity has received more attention in the last years, and in this context, the study of microbiological attributes. This paper assesses the impact of Pinus sp. (pinus) and Araucaria angustifolia (araucária) forest plantations on the microbiological soil attributes and the structure of bacterial communities, which can act as indicators of soil quality. Soil samples have been collected on three areas of the National Forest of Três Barras, in Santa Catarina (SC) state: one area of native forest (F), one area of reforestation with araucária (A) and one area of reforestation with pinus (P). Later on, the soil was chemically and physically characterized and the microbiological analyses were performed, as basal respiration, β-glucosidase and fosfatase enzymatic activity and analysis of bacterial community structure by PCR-DGGE. Low fertility was presented on all three soils collected, highlighting the importance of microorganisms in order to maintain this environment. The β-glucosidase and fosfatase enzymatic activity were higher on the areas F and A, suggesting a higher presence of important microorganisms for nutrients cycling. The analysis of the bacteria community structure resulted in low distinction between the pinus and the araucária areas. This paper presents that based on the microbiological attributes and structure of bacterial communities of soil, in forest plantations of the Atlantic Forest, it is possible to conclude that araucária is the best alternative for reforestation, aiming the maintenance of soil quality. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

Location: Forests in the eastern part of São Miguel Island, Azores. Methods: Point-counts were conducted in two exotic forest habitats (copses of Pittosporum undulatum and plantations of Cryptomeria japónica) and in the native laurel forest. Program DISTANCE was used to estimate ecological densities (birds/ha) for five bird species per forest type. Mist-netting was carried out to assess the relative abundance of birds in four plots representing different altitudes and a gradient of infestation by exotic plants. Results: Nine bird species were recorded during the point-counts, and six of them occurred in the three forest types. Goldcrest Regulus regulus azoricus was the most generalist and abundant species in all forest types and the endemic Azores bullfinch Pyrrhula murina the most specialist, occurring only in native forest. Both point counts and mist-netting showed higher diversity and equitability in areas/plots with native forest, although species richness was not higher than in exotic forests. Mist-netting results showed highest diversity and equitability in the mid-altitude native forest plot. Conclusions: Birds showed a higher relative abundance in native than in exotic forests. Goldcrest was the most abundant species in C. japonica forest whereas the distribution of the Azores bullfinch was heavily restricted by the spread of exotic forest.

	abstract = {The Flow Country blanket bogs in the counties of Caithness and Sutherland (northern Scotland, UK) harbour internationally important populations of specialist open-bog breeding bird species. However, commercial afforestation carried out in the 1980s, involving the non-native tree species lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) covering over 67,000 hectares (ca. 17 \%) of the peatland, has significantly affected bird assemblages within and around the plantations. We conducted a literature review to identify the avian winners and losers resulting from this transformation. Our synthesis of existing findings confirms that afforestation has led to changes in the availability of breeding and foraging habitat, alterations in inter-and intra-specific competition dynamics, and the creation of forest edge effects. Crucially, the open-bog bird assemblages have been largely replaced by woodland specialists and generalists. While 33 species (including five Red-listed Birds of Conservation Concern) are observed to benefit from afforestation, these gains are arguably of lower conservation value than the original open-bog assemblages (27 species including 11 Red-listed species). As a mean proportion of the British population range, the Flow Country has a significantly higher proportion of Amber and Green-listed loser species than winners. Understanding the changes in assemblages is crucial for informing future decisions regarding forest planting and re-planting, particularly in the context of the ongoing dual challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Further research is necessary to comprehend the effects of afforestation on populations of waterfowl associated with open water features present in the blanket bog landscape. Given the need for woodland creation, bird conservation would benefit from leaving naturally open habitats intact and siting new woodland in areas that were formerly naturally forested. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

	abstract = {Monoculture plantations of fast-growing trees are increasing worldwide and, in many cases, these replace highly diverse natural environments. The Mesopotamian Savannas and the Iberá marshes ecoregions of northeastern Argentina are a mosaic of habitat types in which extensive areas of natural grasslands have been replaced by the planting of non-native pines (Pinus spp.). Their impact on the natural communities is unknown. We evaluated the effect of these plantations, the landscape configuration and the forestry management practices on the assemblages of medium to large-size terrestrial mammals of this region at landscape and stand levels. Camera-trap stations were deployed in three environments: 89 in natural grasslands, 54 in native forest patches, and 91 in tree plantations. At a landscape level, we evaluated the effect of the type of environment and of the extent of different land covers on mammal richness per station using GLM, and on species composition using one-way PERMANOVA and redundancy analysis. At a stand level, we assessed the effect of understory vegetation, and of the age and density of tree plantation stands, on the similarity in mammal species composition between tree plantations and native environments, using non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses and GLM. Species richness and species composition differed between native forests and other environments, but not between grasslands and plantations. The variations in composition between the environments differed among the two ecoregions: the species composition in the plantations was different from the grassland assemblage only in the Iberá marshes, which suggests that the impact of tree plantations depends on the local pool of species. Mammal assemblages were also affected by the proportion of forests and wetlands and the environmental heterogeneity in the landscape. The similarity between the mammal assemblages of pine plantations and those of native forests increased with the age of the stand and at intermediate tree densities. In this grassland-dominated but heterogeneous landscape, it seems that most medium and large grassland mammals do not perceive tree plantations as a barrier, regardless of their management. Actions at a stand level, such as planting at intermediate tree densities and promoting longer rotation times, are desirable to encourage the forest mammal assemblage to use the plantations. Forests and wetlands are acting as keystone habitats for many species that are clearly associated with the presence of these environments in the landscape. Keeping large areas of natural grasslands and wetlands sprinkled with forests is essential for the conservation of the mammal assemblages of this region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Stratified sampling was used as the basis of inventories in four types of habitat: young and old teak forests, multi-species plantations and neighboring forests. Mature, sapling and seedling trees were counted and their diameters at breast height were measured. Results. Neighboring residual forests were more diversified than reforestation areas for both mature and sapling trees. For seedling trees, the diversity profiles were similar between the habitats. In all habitats, exotic species were the most abundant. Cedrela odorata, an exotic species, showed a remarkable abundance in neighboring forests. Conclusions. The trends observed in the regeneration of reforested areas suggest that new plantations should be based on several exotic and/or native species to improve plant diversity.},

The study was performed on contiguous sites of native cornel-oak woods and secondary pine monocultures in three different localities of the region (Hrušov, Hrhov, Zádiel) to assess influence of this forest practice on the communities of soil Collembola. Folsomia quadrioculata, Isotomiella minor, Megalothorax minimus and Pseudosinella horaki were correlated with soil-chemical parameters of the organo-mineral layer. The mean abundance of Collembola on plots varied between 9100 and 16,700 ind m-2. In total 83 species were collected, the species richness ranged between 31 and 41 per site. The differences in mean abundance and species richness among compared cornel-oak woods and pine plantations were not distinct, except one locality with mean abundance, species richness and indices of diversity significantly lower at plantation compared to oak wood. Altogether 20 collembolan species occurred exclusively in oak-wood stands, Pseudachorutes dubius having clear affinity to this habitat. Abundance of Ceratophysella luteospina, I. minor, P. horaki and Oncopodura crassicornis obviously prevailed in oak woods. At pine sites, 17 species presented character of exclusivity. Pseudachorutes parvulus, Mesaphorura critica, Orchesella bifasciata and Lipothrix lubbocki apparently preferred pine plantations. The occurrence of Carpathian and Western-Carpathian endemics was random, i.e. in very low density and frequency. CCA ordination technique demonstrated minimal impact of secondary pine growths on the soil collembolan communities. The similarity of Collembola assemblages in thermophilous oak woods and pine monocultures may be explained by similar environmental conditions (microclimate, humus form and soil type) at contiguous sites. Relatively small area of black pine stands likely played a role in faster re-colonisation by epigeic and hemiedaphic Collembola.

	abstract = {Forest management modified the original structure of most European forests, and in the most extreme cases, genuinely natural and semi-natural forests were turned into plantations through clear felling and replanting, often using non-native species. We compared the bird community structure of native oak woods of northern Italy with that of their anthropogenic counter-parts: black locust and sweet chestnut woods. The three stand types were compared in terms of vegetation structure, bird species richness, diversity and abundance of foraging guilds. We analysed both the overwintering and the breeding community, to assess whether management had specific seasonal effects on bird diversity. Forestry-imposed disturbances affected bird diversity more consistently in winter than in breeding time: bird species richness and diversity were significantly greater in oak and chestnut stands, which were the preferred habitat for bark foragers and foliage gleaners. In the breeding period, bird diversity of black locust woodlands increased, and inter-stand differences were not significant. At this time of year, understorey gleaners were more abundant in black locust stands (where shrubs were denser). In winter, species richness, diversity and the abundance of several guilds were positively correlated with stand age, whereas in the breeding period canopy gleaners preferred younger woodlots. Despite the lack of inter-stand differences in breeding bird diversity, young-managed woods benefited generalist birds that need no particular conservation efforts. Conversely, priority species for forest conservation such as specialised bark foragers positively selected native and mature stands throughout the year. We suggest that detailed year-round studies on diversity and community composition could sharpen the precision with which it is possible to prescribe conservation measures in forested areas.},

	abstract = {To be able to plan productive uses of the land compatible with the conservation of the biodiversity, it is essential to evaluate the changes that they cause. The Andean patagonic forests undergo different anthropogenic disturbances, like fires, grazing, wood extraction and substitution by exotic coniferous plantations. These activities cause changes on the vegetation and animal communities, and could be affecting the functioning of the forest ecosystems. In Argentine Patagonia, there is a growing opposition to productive activities, particularly to pine plantations, because of its supposed negative ecological consequences, however their impacts are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate in which measure different uses of the vegetation of the basin of Foyel river (NO Argentine Patagonia) cause changes on bird communities, especially on the functionally important and the endangered species. Birds counts were conducted from November 2004 to March 2005 (summer) using the variable circular-plot method, in twenty four sites of Nothofagus antarctica native forests and scrubs with different levels of grazing and wood extraction (closed, semiopened, opened), and in eight exotic plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus spp. Although, the vegetation structure of each site was characterized, to identify structural elements of the forests that could be important for bird habitat. Population densities of birds did not differ between vegetation types (25.4 ± 8.4 individuals/ha) associated to different disturbances. Bird richness and diversity (Shannon Index), however, were different among the vegetation types, in forestations both were similar to the undisturbed vegetation types, whereas they increased in vegetations with a medium intensity of wood extraction and grazing, and were highest in those sites whit a high intensity of wood extraction and grazing. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis and an analysis of species composition similarity showed that there are two differentiated communities: those of the more altered N. antarctica forests (by grazing and wood extraction), dominated by birds of opened areas; and another community in the rest of the vegetation types, dominated by species characteristic of forests. Among the key species for the Andean patagonic forests processes, foliage insectivores (Elaenia albiceps and Aphrastura spinicauda) were not seriously affected by any of the anthropogenic disturbances; ground insectivores (Scelorchilus rubecula and Pteroptochos tarnii) used the coniferous plantations, but not the areas opened by intense wood extraction and grazing; whereas the wood insectivore species (Campephilus magellanicus) was rare in all types of vegetation. Our results suggest that the structure and composition of the forest bird communities is mainly determined by changes in the structure of the vegetation, and not by changes in the floristic composition. The bird community of the coniferous plantations is similar to the community of the original systems. Intensive wood extraction and grazing, however, cause great changes, incorporating some species to the area, but eliminating others that are forest dependent.},

To put these amphibian surveys into wider context across the plateau and to distinguish local population loss compared to plateau-wide extinctions, we sample diversity at new sampling locations and locations with multiple surveys through time. We then assessed landscape change through remotely sensed data and ground surveys. Amphibian encounter surveys found approximately the same species diversity across all sampling locations, but local extinctions appear likely. Remaining amphibians appear to be limited to small refugia in non-pine wetlands. Approximately half (45\%) of the species found have limited distributional ranges ({\textless}72,000 km2) and are described as habitat specialists by the IUCN Red List. Monitoring pine plantation growth using remote sensing techniques suggested only limited extensions of plantations between 2000 through to 2013–2016, but ground surveys found small pines ({\textless}3 years old) throughout almost all areas identified as grasslands on satellite imagery. Our study highlights the plight of this narrowing biome on the African continent and calls for more research on the impact of non-native plantations on natural communities.

	abstract = {Tree plantations consisting mostly of a single exotic species have been established in Hong Kong, South China, for reforesting degraded lands since the 1950s. In this study, natural woody plant regeneration success under different types of closed-canopy plantations (Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Melaleuca quinquenervia and mixed-plantings) and natural secondary forests in the central New Territories were assessed. A total of 79 tree species, 64 shrubs and 23 woody climbers were recorded in 16 20 m × 20 m plantation plots. Stem density of woody plant regeneration was similar among all sites, ranging from 9031 to 10,950 stems {\textgreater} 0.5 m in height per hectare. Multivariate analysis of understorey species composition showed that there were consistent differences between plantation types. Lophostemon plantations generally had poor native plant colonization in comparison with natural secondary forests and other types of plantations. These differences between forest types can be at least partly attributed to pre-existing site conditions, since the tree species planted were matched to the site. Native woody plant colonization was poor on sites isolated from natural seed sources. Plantation understories were generally dominated by a few species of bird-dispersed shrubs, suggesting that enrichment planting with poorly dispersed shade-tolerant native tree species will be needed to facilitate regeneration in those plantations where natural regeneration is inadequate. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Background and aims: Microbial community characterization is used as a disturbance indicator for soils. However, there is little evidence on the response of soil microbes to restoration. We aim to study the effects of restoration, using different trees, on soil communities and document temporal changes. Methods: On a phosphate mine in Yunnan Province, China we selected sites with different restoration ages (2, 23, and 30 years) and tree species (Eucalyptus globulus (exotic), Cupressus torulosa, Pinus yunnanensis (both indigenous)). Control sites included natural land, and disturbed sites without vegetation. Soil microbial communities were characterized using Phospholipid-derived fatty acids analysis. Soil nutrients concentrations were analysed. Results: Compared to control sites, disturbed soils exhibited significantly lower microbial diversity, bacterial biomass, soil organic carbon and nutrient concentrations. Recultivation with trees restored the soil microbial communities to a state similar to natural soils. Indigenous trees increased soil N concentration, and microbial biomass at a faster rate than the exotic Eucalyptus trees. Soil microbial diversity increased with plantation age. Conclusion: Soil communities can be used as soil health indicators in restoration monitoring. Additionally, soil microbial communities recovered fastest under indigenous compared to exotic trees, which further underlines the importance of tree species selection in restoration management. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Cassidinae in forest floor vegetation were studied in five different forest habitats in Kibale Forest, Western Uganda, by monthly sweep net sampling during 23 months from July 1983 to May 1985 and in September 1986. The studied habitats were two virgin forest sites, two selectively logged sites and one exotic pine plantation. Altogether 22 Cassidinae species were found. The peak numbers of Cassidinae per sample were found in the early dry season after the long rains. The most common species in all sites was Cassida humerosa. There does not seem to be any Cassidinae species which are specialized for life in virgin forest. Several species occurring in the managed forest sites were not found in virgin forest. In logged forest sites and in the exotic pine plantation higher species numbers were caught than in virgin forest sites. The species composition of pine plantation differed significantly from those in all other sites. In a species‐wise factor analysis, the two logged sites were close to each other and to the pine plantation. Dans cinq habitats différents de la forêt de Kibale, dans l'ouest ougandais, on a étudié les Cassidinae du sol forestier au moyen d'un filet, de juillet 1983 à mai 1985 et en septembre 1986. Les endroits étudiés étaient deux sites de forêt vierge, deux sites exploités pour le bois et une plantation de conifères exotiques. En tout, on a trouvé 22 espèces de Cassidinae. Les nombres maximaux de Cassidinae par échantillon ont été relevés en début de saison sèche après la grande saison des pluies. Partout, l'espèce la plus commune est Cassida humerosa. II ne semble pas exister d'espèce de Cassidinae qui soit spécialisée pour la vie en forêt vierge. Certaines espèces récoltées en forêt exploitée ne se retrouvent pas en forêt vierge. Dans les forêts exploitées et dans les plantations de conifères exotiques, on attrapait un plus grand nombre d'espèces qu'en forêt vierge. La composition des espèces dans la plantation de conifères différait significativement de celle des autres milieux. Dans l'analyse ayant trait aux espèces elles‐mêmes, les deux sites exploités étaient proches l'un de l'autre et de la plantation de conifères. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

	abstract = {The continued decline of natural forests globally has increased interest in the potential of planted forests to support biodiversity. Here, we examine the potential conservation benefits of plantation forests from an Irish perspective, a country where remaining natural forests are fragmented and degraded, and the majority of the forest area is comprised of non-native Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) plantations. We examine the true value of Irish plantation forests to native biodiversity, relative to remaining natural forest fragments, and to prior and alternative land use to afforestation. We find that plantation forests provide a suitable surrogate habitat primarily for generalist species, as well as providing habitat for certain species of conservation concern. However, we find that plantation forests provide poor habitat for native forest specialists, and examine potential management strategies which may be employed to improve habitat provision services for this group.},

	abstract = {An investigation was carried out in Olokemeji Forest Reserve (Nigeria) to examine the impact of farming activities on the vegetation of the reserve. The 5,888 hectare forest reserve was divided into three zones for the purpose of this study. They are natural forest (zone 1), plantation (zone 2) and the fallow area (zone 3). Ten plots of 40m x 50m were randomly selected from each zone for enumeration. In addition 100 questionnaires were administered to elicit information on the effects of farming activities on the plant resources of the Olokemeji forest reserve. The inverse of Simpson diversity indices of the three zones showed that zone 1 had 43.5, zone 2, 2.1 and zone 3, 11.8. The very low diversity indices recorded in zones 2 and 3 resulted from the extensive and intensive farming activities as most species in the zones had been cut down during farm clearing. Farming activities in the reserve have resulted in large hectares of impoverished secondary forest, bare and degraded lands, grasslands and plantation of exotic species. About 25 plants useful to the respondents have also been lost due to farming activities. © 2004 GLOBAL NEST.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the effects of tree species on the soil environment is crucial for implementation of sustainable forest management. The aim of our study was thus to compare the effects of 14 tree species with contrasting traits and origin in Poland and/or Europe on fungal and bacterial diversity in soils. To reduce confounding factors such as differences in topography, microclimate, the age of the tree stand, the admixture of other tree species and soil type, we used a common garden experiment, comprising 14 tree species planted 50 years ago as monoculture plots. We examined soil microbial communities via metabarcoding of bacteria and fungi, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, followed by Illumina sequencing. The highest fungal species richness was found under Acer pseudoplatanus, whereas Carpinus betulus and Quercus rubra were characterized by the lowest species richness. Acer pseudoplatanus and Tilia cordata were associated with the highest species richness of bacteria, followed by Acer platanoides. Fungal composition was mainly explained by the tree species identity, while bacterial composition was explained by soil chemical properties, namely pH and contents of exchangeable Ca, K and Mg. Interaction between tree species identity and soil chemical properties was also important. Tree species belonging to the same genus tended to harbor microbial communities with similar structures, while we did not observe a clear difference between broadleaf and coniferous trees, and between native and alien species. We suggest using admixtures of Acer spp. and T. cordata to improve soil microbial diversity in the process of afforestation of new areas and in restoration of degraded lands. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Pseudotsuga menziesii is one of the most widely planted conifers in the Patagonian Andes of Argentina, having invading characteristics that are broadly reported. We studied the mycorrhizal status of seedlings along six Nothofagaceae + P. menziesii invasion matrices to investigate their role in the invasive process, according to these hypothesis: a) The abundance and richness of EM will be higher in seedlings grown in their own soil; b) In the presence of native EM inoculum, the invasive plant will be associated with generalist mycorrhizae (EM and/or AM), c) AM associations will be more abundant in P. menziesii seedlings grown in Interface or native forest soils, d) Mycorrhizal community differences between treatments will alter host fitness (growth and nutritional parameters). Seedlings from Nothofagus dombeyi, N. antarctica, Lophozonia alpina, L. obliqua and Pseudotsuga menziesii were set up in a soil-bioassay that included soils from non-invaded Nothofagaceae forests, pure P. menziesii plantations, and the interface between both. Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings showed a decreasing, although never null, ectomycorrhizal (EM) colonization pattern from plantations to non-invaded forests, mainly with exotic EM species. Hebeloma mesophaeum and Wilcoxina sp. 1, two EM species with cosmopolitan distribution, were found to be shared by both tree species. Hebeloma hiemale and Wilcoxina sp. 1, common mycorrhizal partners of P. menziesii in Patagonia although not registered from Nothofagaceae forest, were found to be associated with N. antarctica, being the first report for both fungal species. Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings showed the ability to form different arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) colonization types (Paris-, Arum-, Both- and Intermediate-types) depending on the treatments, with significantly higher presence of Intermediate-type in the Interface treatment, where colonization was low. The shared EM species and the presence of different AM colonization types imply enhanced possibilities for invasive P. menziesii seedlings establishment and development. Seedling features and EM colonization rates evidenced that P. menziesii invasion could produce maladaptation (defined as a relative decline in host fitness due to altered mycorrhizal communities from native settings) of mycorrhizal communities, seriously injuring native ecosystem. © 2018},

	abstract = {The change in tree species composition is an important process influencing forest biodiversity worldwide. Therefore, it is important to reveal its actual impacts on forest biodiversity. We selected three animal groups (birds, beetles and soil macroinvertebrates) with different dispersal abilities to answer the following scientific question: how does the replacement of a native tree species, pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), by the non-native red oak (Q. rubra) affect the species richness and compositions of the analyzed animal groups? We selected ten lowland woodlands surrounding the city of Pardubice (Czech Republic). In total, forty patches with twenty in mature native oak and twenty in mature non-native oak were studied in the 2017 vegetation season. We found that the effect of the tree species on the species richness was mainly negative for both oak species. The samples with the highest species richness coincided with stands containing mixed native and non-native oak trees. The species composition results indicated that several species avoided red oak, but highly similar numbers of species indicated the same avoidance of the native oak. The results of our study revealed that the effect of non-native vegetation was not as profound as expected, compared to the effect of native vegetation. Neither native nor non-native vegetation significantly affected even flightless fauna. Nevertheless, the extensive planting of non-native trees is not advantageous for many known reasons (e.g., invasibility). An important approach when using non-native trees like red oak in forests is to plant these species admixed or interspersed. In these cases, the impacts of non-native species on the biota are not necessarily negative. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},
